# Bubble Trouble: Olin Edition
This is the base repo for our interactive programming project for Software Design, Spring 2016 at Olin College.

Included in the folder are the .png files necessary to display the bubbles correctly, the .ogg files necessary to play the sound effects correctly, and the .ttf files to display the text correctly. 

When downloading the font, open with Font Viewer and install it to the computer system's font folder to implement the correct font.

Open the main.py file in Sublime Text, and run build!
